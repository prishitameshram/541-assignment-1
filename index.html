            <p>Hey there, I'm Prishita, and as an aspiring UX/UI designer, I love making things look awesome on the internet! When COVID-19 hit, I thought, "Why not learn some cool coding stuff?" So, I took some basic coding classes to level up my skills.</p>
            <p>I've played around with making websites look good on all sorts of devices, and I've even tamed the Bootstrap beast a bit. But, you know what? It's been a while, and I want to get back in the game.</p>
            <p>This course is a great opportunity for me to revisit the basics and expand my coding knowledge.</p>
